# PSEG-Explorations-in-STEM-Research-Project
Initiated Summer 2015 Research Project, and to be continued within a different project.

• Attached is the poster I presented at the Summer Research Symposium at Stony Brook University in August 2015.

• Poster was also presented at the 2015 Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers National Conference at the Research and Innovation in STEM (RISE) Symposia

• Worked on a research project with Professor Paul Fodor from Stony Brook University's Computer Science Department
• Program sponsored and funded by Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG)
• Abstract Title: Efficient Power Delivery Using Artificial Intelligence Planning
• Abstract:
The purpose of this research project is to design an efficient planning algorithm to implement power delivery in smart power grids. For example, think about a map of the “Lower 48 States” in the United States, and only four main power plants in four different states. From these four power plants, the goal is to power on a data center. Junctions and switches connect power plants and data centers. The problem is to find the shortest sequential plan to power on a data center by turning on the least amount of power switches, which connect to junctions and to one of the main power plants.
• Methods:
A Prolog algorithm is developed utilizing it’s artificial intelligence power to solve the power system-planning problem, while Python is used to implement a graphical user interface to illustrate the logic of the Prolog algorithm.
